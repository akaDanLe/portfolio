## About me

Hi there! My name is Dan Le and I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from the University of California, Santa Barbara. As a chemical engineering student, I have developed a strong attention to detail, analytical skills, and structured approach to problem-solving. I have gained extensive experience in computational physical chemistry and modeling of chemical reactions. Additionally, I possess an outgoing personality which allows me to easily communicate and collaborate with others.

I am eager to transition into the field of software engineering and explore my passion for problem-solving and analytical thinking. My goal is to apply my research skills to software testing and gain hands-on experience. I am confident that my experience as a chemical engineering student has prepared me with the necessary skills to excel in software. I am excited to explore this new career path and look forward to growing in the field of software engineering.
